# SansFinder - [Live Release](http://www.sansfinder.com)

Sansfinder is a one-stop web application designed to help Sansevieria collectors find plants with ease.

One of the main problems amongst Sanseveria (snake plants) collectors is that it can be difficult to browse dozens of websites, often with terrible user interfaces, just to find the plant you're looking for, and then you have to compare prices. This takes a great deal of time. SansFinder solves this by putting everything in one place, with an easy to use interface, and with 3 main sorting options. 

SansFinder is powered by a Python + Algolia Search backend that scouts the web for hundreds of Sansevieria listings and aggregates them into one database. The up-to-date data is then sent to the Algolia Search service so that users can take advantage of relevant search results.

## Usage

In order to use SansFinder, all you need to do is type your search query, such as "Sansevieria Masoniana" or "Whale Fin," and SansFinder will understand what you're looking for and show you all the relevant results.

To browse all the available plants, just click on the search icon without typing a query.

## Technologies

SansFinder was a challening application to build because, as a Frontend Web Developer, I also had to create the backend for SansFinder in Python and then use Docker to easily deploy it. Thankfully, the process was straightforward and I ended up with an understanding of how powerful and useful Docker can be.

Here is a list of all the technologies used to create SansFinder:

### Frontend
* React Js
* JavaScript
* HTML / CSS
* Tailwind CSS
* Figma
* Canva

### Backend
* Python
* Docker
* Algolia API Client
* Digital Ocean
  * App Platform
  * Container Registry
